Hands-on (engineering manager / architect / developer) with a PhD.

[I'm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/movereem/) an Engineering Manager at [AFAS](http://www.afas.nl/) and lead a team responsible for the low-code platform underneath our new accountancy cloud platform. I combine management, architecture, and hands-on development work with an interest for [scientific research](https://www.movereem.nl/pubspres.html). My main interests are low-code platforms, event sourced systems, and the evolution of these systems.

I ❤ the quote ["talk is cheap, show me the code"](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132).
