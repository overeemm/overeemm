👋

I [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/movereem/) at [AFAS](http://www.afas.nl/) as Lead Software Architect. 
Occasionally I [write](https://www.movereem.nl/pubspres.html) a paper on [research](http://amuse-project.org/) I'm doing.

I ❤ the quote ["talk is cheap, show me the code"](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132).
